# Operations and loops
1. Loops
    - for loops through a block of code a number of times
        ```for (car i = 0; i < 0; i++){document.write(i):}
    - while loops through a block of code while a specific condition is true
2. Logical operators
    - Operators return true or false based on a comparison
    - ```== += === != && ||```
