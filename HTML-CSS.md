3. HTML 5
    - Replaces &lt;div&gt; elements with more specific ones i.e. &lt;header&gt; & &lt;footer&gt;
    - &lt;article&gt; element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated
    - &lt;aside&gt; element has two functions depending on if it is inside or outside an &lt;article&gt;
    - &lt;section&gt; groups related content together
    - New HTML 5 elemts indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page 
4. Extra Markup
    - HTML 5 uses the same format as XHTML which allows it to run its code
    - &lt;!-- --&gt; denotes a comment in HTML 5
    - Block elements such as &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;p,&gt;, and &lt;ul&gt; start a new line
    - Inline elements will continue on the same line
    - frames insert a window
