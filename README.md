#Growth Mindset
- Approaching every problem as an opportunity to learn
##Examples:
1. When I get frustrated...
   -  ***Remember that putting in more effort and time will always lead to success.***
2. When someone else is doing better than me...
  - *Remember that everyone learns at different paces and specialize in different aspects of life.*
3. When I feel overwhelmed...
  - _Remember that there are many ways to get help._
