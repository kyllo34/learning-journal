# ***Growth Mindset***
- Approaching every problem as an opportunity to learn

## Reminders:
1. When I get frustrated...
   - ***Remember that putting in more effort and time will always lead to success.***
2. When someone else is doing better than me...
   - *Remember that everyone learns at different paces and specialize in different aspects of life.*
3. When I feel overwhelmed...
   - _Remember that there a complex problem is just a collection of simple ones._
