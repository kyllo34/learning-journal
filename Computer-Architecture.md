# Computer Architecture & Logic
- Computers take input, store it, process it, and generate output
- Binary is the basis for all programming/information
    - 1-0, on-off, in-out
    - 1001 = 9 in binary f(1 * 8, 0 * 4, 0 * 2, 1 * 1)
- Logic gates are used to take input and change them at the most basic level
    - and, nand, xor, or etc
- CPUs and memory store and process information
- Software interacts with hardware
- Memory stores commands and the CPU executes them
